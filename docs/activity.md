- **USER**: Please wire up Supabase auth with my login page.
- **ASSISTANT**: Wired up Supabase authentication with the login page. Created Supabase client configuration with SSR support (client.ts, server.ts, middleware.ts), authentication context (auth-context.tsx), AuthGuard component for route protection, updated LoginForm to use real Supabase authentication instead of mock localStorage, and updated all protected pages (reports, locations, materials, comments, add report) to use AuthGuard. Created environment template file (.env.example) with required Supabase configuration variables.
- **USER**: What should I build my backend and database with?
- **ASSISTANT**: Recommended PostgreSQL with Next.js Route Handlers/Server Actions, Kysely for type-safe queries, and managed DB (Neon/Supabase). Provided detailed comparison of options.
- **USER**: Wouldn't it be easier just to use Supabase for all this?
- **ASSISTANT**: Confirmed Supabase as excellent choice, recommended hybrid approach (Supabase for auth/DB/storage, Next.js for API) for best developer experience.
- **USER**: I am going full Supabase. Please write me instructions to initialize Supabase for my project.
- **ASSISTANT**: Provided step-by-step Supabase initialization instructions including CLI setup, project creation, migration setup, and environment configuration.
- **USER**: I want to use Supabase's built in auth.users table as the source of truth for authentication. Please remove the users table I just created.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created migration `20250818223019_switch_to_auth_users.sql` to drop custom users table, create profiles table linked to auth.users, update foreign keys to UUIDs, set up RLS policies, and create auto-profile-creation trigger. Fixed UUID casting error by setting old integer author_ids to NULL during migration.
- **USER**: Please help me perform the actions in scripts 02-09 within Supabase.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created and applied migrations for scripts 03-09: locations/areas seeding, materials seeding, database views (updated for profiles table), statistics/triggers. Created Node.js script for test user creation since auth.users can't be seeded directly. Provided manual user creation instructions as alternative.
- **USER**: Yes, please continue with the next steps following option B.
- **ASSISTANT**: Installed dependencies, ran user creation script successfully creating 4 test users with UUIDs, updated migrations with real user IDs, created and applied final migrations for reports/pest findings, comments, and material links. Completed full database seeding equivalent to original scripts 02-09.
- **USER**: In @database-schema.md write me a markdown document outlining the structure of the database.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created `docs/database-schema.md` with a detailed breakdown of the database schema, including tables, views, and automation scripts.
- **USER**: Explain the architecture of the database that these sql scripts set up.
- **ASSISTANT**: Analyzed the SQL scripts and provided a detailed explanation of the Pestwise database architecture, covering core tables, design patterns, database views for analytics, automation features, and scalability considerations.
