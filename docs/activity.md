- **USER**: Please make the name and role at the bottom of the sidebar reflect the currently logged in user.
- **ASSISTANT**: Updated sidebar component to display the currently logged in user's name and role dynamically. Added useAuth hook to get profile data, created getInitials function to generate user initials from name, and replaced hardcoded "John Doe" and "Technician" with actual user data from the profiles table. Added loading states and fallbacks for better UX when data is still being fetched.
- **USER**: Look at my browser console logs when trying to register a new user. Fix my issues: [Log] Attempting to sign up with: â€“ "test@gmail.com" [Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 () (signup, line 0) [Error] Sign up error: AuthApiError: Database error saving new user
- **ASSISTANT**: Fixed database issues preventing user registration. The problem was missing Row Level Security (RLS) INSERT policy for the profiles table and trigger function issues. Created migration 20250120000000_fix_user_registration.sql that adds INSERT policy allowing authenticated users to insert their own profile, updated trigger function to handle missing role metadata with proper fallbacks (defaults to 'technician'), and added error handling. Applied migration successfully with `npx supabase db push --include-all`. User registration should now work correctly.
- **USER**: Please add a registration page that adds a new user with Supabase Auth.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created a complete user registration system with Supabase Auth. Added signUp function to auth-context.tsx that uses Supabase's auth.signUp() method with name metadata. Created RegisterForm component with name, email, password, and confirm password fields with validation (password length, matching passwords). Built registration page at /register route with proper AuthGuard protection. Added navigation links between login and registration pages for seamless user flow. Registration includes email confirmation flow and automatic redirect to login after successful signup.
- **USER**: Please make sure that the Sign out button successfully logs the user out using Supabase Auth.
- **ASSISTANT**: Enhanced the sign out functionality to ensure reliable logout using Supabase Auth. Improved the signOut function in auth-context.tsx with proper error handling, immediate local state clearing, and comprehensive logging. Updated the sidebar logout handler to properly wait for sign out completion before navigation and added fallback navigation even if errors occur. The implementation now calls supabase.auth.signOut() with proper error handling and clears both user and profile state immediately for better UX.
- **USER**: Fix this error: createUnhandledError@ handleClientError@ error@ validateDOMNesting@ completeWork@ runWithFiberInDEV@ completeUnitOfWork@ performUnitOfWork@ workLoopSync@ renderRootSync@ performWorkOnRoot@ performWorkOnRootViaSchedulerTask@ performWorkUntilDeadline@ ul@unknown:0:0 LoginForm@
- **ASSISTANT**: Fixed React hydration error caused by invalid HTML structure in LoginForm component. The issue was a `<ul>` element nested inside a `<p>` element (lines 96-105), which is invalid HTML. Restructured the code to use a `<div>` container with separate `<p>` and `<ul>` elements, maintaining proper styling with Tailwind classes.
- **USER**: Make the SIgn out button actually log out of the account with Supabase Auth.
- **ASSISTANT**: Updated the sidebar logout functionality to use proper Supabase Auth. Replaced localStorage clearing with the signOut function from auth context, which calls supabase.auth.signOut() and properly handles authentication state management.
- **USER**: There seems to be a bug. I was playing around with the app and now when on http://localhost:3000/ I am stuck on an infinte Loading... screen.
- **ASSISTANT**: Debugged infinite loading issue caused by missing Supabase environment variables. Added error handling and debugging to auth context, created SupabaseConfigError component for better user experience, and provided step-by-step setup instructions. The issue was that .env.local wasn't configured with actual Supabase credentials.
- **USER**: Please wire up Supabase auth with my login page.
- **ASSISTANT**: Wired up Supabase authentication with the login page. Created Supabase client configuration with SSR support (client.ts, server.ts, middleware.ts), authentication context (auth-context.tsx), AuthGuard component for route protection, updated LoginForm to use real Supabase authentication instead of mock localStorage, and updated all protected pages (reports, locations, materials, comments, add report) to use AuthGuard. Created environment template file (.env.example) with required Supabase configuration variables.
- **USER**: What should I build my backend and database with?
- **ASSISTANT**: Recommended PostgreSQL with Next.js Route Handlers/Server Actions, Kysely for type-safe queries, and managed DB (Neon/Supabase). Provided detailed comparison of options.
- **USER**: Wouldn't it be easier just to use Supabase for all this?
- **ASSISTANT**: Confirmed Supabase as excellent choice, recommended hybrid approach (Supabase for auth/DB/storage, Next.js for API) for best developer experience.
- **USER**: I am going full Supabase. Please write me instructions to initialize Supabase for my project.
- **ASSISTANT**: Provided step-by-step Supabase initialization instructions including CLI setup, project creation, migration setup, and environment configuration.
- **USER**: I want to use Supabase's built in auth.users table as the source of truth for authentication. Please remove the users table I just created.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created migration `20250818223019_switch_to_auth_users.sql` to drop custom users table, create profiles table linked to auth.users, update foreign keys to UUIDs, set up RLS policies, and create auto-profile-creation trigger. Fixed UUID casting error by setting old integer author_ids to NULL during migration.
- **USER**: Please help me perform the actions in scripts 02-09 within Supabase.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created and applied migrations for scripts 03-09: locations/areas seeding, materials seeding, database views (updated for profiles table), statistics/triggers. Created Node.js script for test user creation since auth.users can't be seeded directly. Provided manual user creation instructions as alternative.
- **USER**: Yes, please continue with the next steps following option B.
- **ASSISTANT**: Installed dependencies, ran user creation script successfully creating 4 test users with UUIDs, updated migrations with real user IDs, created and applied final migrations for reports/pest findings, comments, and material links. Completed full database seeding equivalent to original scripts 02-09.
- **USER**: In @database-schema.md write me a markdown document outlining the structure of the database.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created `docs/database-schema.md` with a detailed breakdown of the database schema, including tables, views, and automation scripts.
- **USER**: Explain the architecture of the database that these sql scripts set up.
- **ASSISTANT**: Analyzed the SQL scripts and provided a detailed explanation of the Pestwise database architecture, covering core tables, design patterns, database views for analytics, automation features, and scalability considerations.

### WebSocket Error Explanation

**Prompt**: What's this browser console error mean?

**Error**: [Error] WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/\_next/webpack-hmr' failed: WebSocket is closed due to suspension.

**Explanation and Troubleshooting Steps**:
This error typically indicates that the Hot Module Replacement (HMR) WebSocket connection, which Next.js uses to update your browser instantly when you make code changes, has failed.

**Potential Causes**:

1.  **Browser Tab Suspension/Throttling**: Some browsers might suspend or throttle background tabs.
2.  **Network Issues**: Intermittent network problems, firewalls, or VPNs can interfere.
3.  **Ad Blockers/Browser Extensions**: Certain extensions can sometimes block WebSocket connections.
4.  **Development Server Issues**: The Next.js development server itself might have crashed or become unresponsive.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

1.  **Restart the Development Server**: Often the quickest fix.
2.  **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**: Sometimes cached data can interfere.
3.  **Try a Different Browser**: Helps determine if it's browser-specific.
4.  **Check for Ad Blockers/Extensions**: Temporarily disable them.
5.  **Check Network and Firewall Settings**: Ensure nothing is blocking `localhost:3000`.
6.  **Update Node.js/npm**: Ensure Node.js and npm are up to date.
