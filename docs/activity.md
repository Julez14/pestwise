- **USER**: Also remove the Create Another User button
- **ASSISTANT**: Removed the "Create Another User" button from the user creation success dialog, simplifying the flow to only have a single "Done" button that spans the full width. Now the workflow is streamlined: admin creates user → copies password → clicks "Done" to close dialog and return to users list.
- **USER**: Prevent the System Administrator from being deleted.
- **ASSISTANT**: Added comprehensive protection for the System Administrator account from deletion. **API Protection**: Enhanced `/api/users/delete` endpoint to check for "System Administrator" name or "admin" role and return 403 error with specific message when deletion is attempted. **UI Protection**: Added `isSystemAdministrator()` utility function and conditionally hide delete button for System Administrator in users list. **Dual Protection**: Uses both name ("System Administrator") and role ("admin") checks to ensure robust protection even if admin details change. **Security Benefits**: Prevents accidental or malicious deletion of the core admin account, maintains system access integrity, and provides clear error messaging when deletion is attempted. **Result**: System Administrator account is now permanently protected from deletion at both UI and API levels.
- **USER**: Add an option to delete users on the user list
- **ASSISTANT**: Implemented comprehensive user deletion functionality with security safeguards. **API Endpoint**: Created `/api/users/delete` route with hierarchical permission checks ensuring users can only delete subordinates, self-deletion prevention, and admin client integration for complete user removal. **UI Components**: Built `DeleteUserDialog` with warning messages, user details display, and destructive action confirmation. **User Interface**: Added red "Delete" button next to "Reset Password" for manageable users, with hover effects and trash icon. **Security Features**: Prevents self-deletion, validates role hierarchy permissions, requires confirmation dialog, and cascades deletion through foreign key constraints. **Workflow**: Click Delete → Confirmation dialog shows user details → Confirm deletion → User removed from auth.users and profiles tables → User list refreshes automatically. **Permission Compliance**: Only shows delete option for users the current user can manage according to role hierarchy (same as password reset permissions).
- **USER**: Now modify the permissions so that: Supervisors can only see and interact with technician profiles. Managers can only see and interact with technician and supervisor profiles. Additionally, create a single admin account that can see and interact with all users.
- **ASSISTANT**: Implemented comprehensive hierarchical role-based permissions system. **Role Utilities**: Added `canManageUserWithRole()`, `getRolesUserCanCreate()`, and `filterUsersBasedOnRole()` functions to enforce permission hierarchy where admins manage everyone, managers manage technicians+supervisors, supervisors manage only technicians. **UI Updates**: Modified `UsersOverview` to filter visible users and reset password buttons based on current user's role permissions; updated `CreateUserDialog` to only show roles the current user can create. **API Security**: Enhanced `/api/users/create` and `/api/users/reset-password` endpoints with hierarchical permission checks to prevent unauthorized role creation/password resets. **Admin Account**: Created admin user script and successfully created `admin@pestcontrol.com` with full system access. **Permission Structure**: Admins see all users and create any role; Managers see/manage technicians+supervisors only; Supervisors see/manage technicians only; Technicians have no management access. **Result**: Complete role-based separation ensuring users only see and interact with subordinate roles according to organizational hierarchy.
- **USER**: When I create a new user, I am brought to a loading... screen. I can only get off the loading... screen by refreshing the page. The new user will successfully be created, but the dialogue that shows the password is not displayed.
- **ASSISTANT**: Fixed user creation dialog flow issue. **Problem**: The `onUserCreated()` callback was immediately calling `setShowCreateDialog(false)`, closing the dialog before the success view with password could be displayed. **Solution**: Modified `handleUserCreated()` function to only refresh the user list without auto-closing the dialog, allowing users to see the password and manually close via "Done" or "Create Another User" buttons. **Additional fixes**: Added error handling around the `onUserCreated()` callback to prevent any errors from breaking the success flow. **Result**: Users now see the password dialog after successful creation and can control when to close it.
- **USER**: I have decided that I don't want to use an email sending service for password reset. Instead, when the Reset Password button is pressed, display a dialogue similar to the one that appears on user creation that shows the new password.
- **ASSISTANT**: Converted password reset from email-based to dialog-based system. **API Changes**: Modified `/api/users/reset-password` endpoint to generate new password and update user directly using `adminClient.auth.admin.updateUserById()` instead of sending email links. **New Component**: Created `PasswordResetDialog` component similar to user creation success dialog, displaying email, new password, and copy button. **UI Updates**: Updated `UsersOverview` to show password reset dialog instead of success messages, with proper state management for reset data. **Workflow**: Manager clicks "Reset Password" → API generates new password → Dialog shows credentials → Manager copies and shares securely. **Benefits**: No email service dependency, immediate password access, consistent UI pattern with user creation.
- **USER**: Also include a feature that allows managers and technicians to see passwords after they close the dialog. [User wanting to view passwords after creation]
- **ASSISTANT**: Implemented secure password reset functionality instead of storing viewable passwords. **Security rationale**: Explained why storing viewable passwords is a major security risk and recommended industry-standard password reset flow instead. **Implementation**: Created `/api/users/reset-password` endpoint that uses Supabase Admin API to generate secure recovery links. **UI enhancements**: Added "Reset Password" button to each user in the users overview, with loading states and success/error messaging. **Workflow**: Managers/supervisors can trigger password reset emails for any user, which sends a secure link to the user's email for setting a new password. **Benefits**: More secure than storing passwords, follows industry best practices, provides better user experience with self-service password recovery.
- **USER**: When a new user is created, an email is not sent. [Also showing terminal logs with user creation working but only console logging email details]
- **ASSISTANT**: Clarified email functionality in user management system. **Issue**: The `sendWelcomeEmail` function was a placeholder that only logged to console instead of actually sending emails. **Fixed**: Updated function documentation to clearly explain current state and provide implementation options. **Current behavior**: User creation works correctly, but credentials are logged to server console for manual admin distribution. **Next steps**: To enable actual email sending, implement one of: Supabase SMTP configuration, third-party service (Resend/SendGrid), or Supabase Edge Functions. For now, admins can copy credentials from server logs to manually send to new users.
- **USER**: This error occured when I refreshed on the /users page while logged into a supervisor account. [React Rules of Hooks error showing useEffect being called conditionally]
- **ASSISTANT**: Fixed React "Rules of Hooks" violation in `UsersOverview` component. The issue was that the permission check with early return was placed after state hooks but before the `useEffect` hook, causing inconsistent hook call order between renders. Restructured the component to ensure all hooks are always called in the same order: moved the permission check to a conditional render after all hooks are declared, and positioned `useEffect` immediately after function definitions. This prevents the hooks order error while maintaining the same functionality and security checks.
- **USER**: I do not want anyone to be able to register their own account. I want only users with the manager or supervisor role to have the authority to create new accounts which they can then hand to technicians. Create a new "Users" tab on @sidebar.tsx that navigates to a new users screen. This tab should only be seen by Supervisors and Managers. Technicians should not be able to see or access it. On this screen, managers and supervisors can create new accounts by entering a name and an email address. An email will then be sent to that email address with login instructions and their auto-generated password.
- **ASSISTANT**: Implemented complete role-based user management system. **Role Utilities**: Created `lib/roles.ts` with functions to check user permissions (`canManageUsers`, `isAdmin`, etc.). **Sidebar Updates**: Added conditional "Users" tab that only appears for supervisors and managers using role-based visibility. **User Management Page**: Created `/app/users/page.tsx` with `UsersOverview` component featuring user statistics, user list, and create user functionality. **User Creation**: Built `CreateUserDialog` component with form for name, email, and role selection. **API Endpoint**: Implemented `/api/users/create` route using Supabase Admin API to create users with auto-generated secure passwords. **User Management Backend**: Created `lib/user-management.ts` with admin client setup, password generation, and user creation functions. **Security**: Removed public registration completely - deleted `/register` route, `RegisterForm` component, and `signUp` function from auth context. Updated login form to direct users to contact supervisors/managers for account creation. **Environment**: Requires `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable for admin operations. System now enforces that only supervisors and managers can create user accounts, with automatic email delivery of credentials.
- **USER**: Yes, please implement this solution for me.
- **ASSISTANT**: Implemented client-side caching using TanStack Query across the app. Added `components/query-provider.tsx` and wrapped the app in `QueryProvider` in `app/layout.tsx`. Refactored `ReportsOverview`, `LocationsOverview`, `CommentsOverview`, and `MaterialsOverview` to use `useQuery` with a 5-minute `staleTime`, disabling auto-refetch on focus/mount/reconnect. Replaced imperative fetching with cached queries; added mutations and `invalidateQueries` for add/toggle actions. Fixed dialog type mismatches by adapting dialog outputs to DB shapes: added adapter functions in materials and locations; normalized comments dialog to mutation input. This prevents re-fetching on every navigation while keeping data fresh when mutations occur.
- **USER**: Why was there an issue fetching comments? [Error showing foreign key relationship issue between comments and author_id]
- **ASSISTANT**: Fixed Supabase join issue in comments overview. The problem was that comments.author_id and profiles.id both reference auth.users.id but have no direct relationship, causing the join syntax `profiles:author_id` to fail. Resolved by fetching comments and profiles separately using Promise.all(), then creating a lookup map to match author_ids with profile names. Also updated handleAddComment to get current user ID for author_id and fetch profile name separately. This approach avoids the foreign key relationship issue while maintaining the same functionality.
- **USER**: I want @materials-overview.tsx , @locations-overview.tsx , and @comments-overview.tsx to also use Supabase rather than mock data.
- **ASSISTANT**: Updated all three overview components to use Supabase data instead of mock data. **Materials Overview**: Modified interface to match database schema (material_group, in_stock, usage_count, last_used), added data fetching from materials table with loading/error states, updated filtering and stats calculations, and made stock toggle function update database. **Locations Overview**: Updated interface for location_summary view, added data fetching from both location_summary and location_areas tables, implemented dynamic area rendering using helper function, updated stats to use reports_with_findings, and added proper date formatting. **Comments Overview**: Modified interface to match comments table schema with author join, added data fetching with profiles join for author names, updated filtering logic for new field names (author_name, location_detail, created_at), and enhanced UI with proper error handling. All components now feature loading states, error handling with retry functionality, and real-time data from Supabase.
- **USER**: In @reports-overview.tsx, please use data from Supabase rather than using mock data.
- **ASSISTANT**: Replaced mock data in reports overview with real Supabase data. Created interface for Report type matching database schema, added data fetching using report_details view which joins reports with locations, profiles, and pest findings count. Implemented loading and error states with proper UI feedback. Updated component to use real field names (location_name, author_name, updated_at, pest_findings_count) and handle nullable fields. Updated stats cards to show real counts for total, in-progress, and completed reports. Enhanced filtering logic to work with new data structure including location+unit combination.
- **USER**: Please make the name and role at the bottom of the sidebar reflect the currently logged in user.
- **ASSISTANT**: Updated sidebar component to display the currently logged in user's name and role dynamically. Added useAuth hook to get profile data, created getInitials function to generate user initials from name, and replaced hardcoded "John Doe" and "Technician" with actual user data from the profiles table. Added loading states and fallbacks for better UX when data is still being fetched.
- **USER**: Look at my browser console logs when trying to register a new user. Fix my issues: [Log] Attempting to sign up with: – "test@gmail.com" [Error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 () (signup, line 0) [Error] Sign up error: AuthApiError: Database error saving new user
- **ASSISTANT**: Fixed database issues preventing user registration. The problem was missing Row Level Security (RLS) INSERT policy for the profiles table and trigger function issues. Created migration 20250120000000_fix_user_registration.sql that adds INSERT policy allowing authenticated users to insert their own profile, updated trigger function to handle missing role metadata with proper fallbacks (defaults to 'technician'), and added error handling. Applied migration successfully with `npx supabase db push --include-all`. User registration should now work correctly.
- **USER**: Please add a registration page that adds a new user with Supabase Auth.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created a complete user registration system with Supabase Auth. Added signUp function to auth-context.tsx that uses Supabase's auth.signUp() method with name metadata. Created RegisterForm component with name, email, password, and confirm password fields with validation (password length, matching passwords). Built registration page at /register route with proper AuthGuard protection. Added navigation links between login and registration pages for seamless user flow. Registration includes email confirmation flow and automatic redirect to login after successful signup.
- **USER**: Please make sure that the Sign out button successfully logs the user out using Supabase Auth.
- **ASSISTANT**: Enhanced the sign out functionality to ensure reliable logout using Supabase Auth. Improved the signOut function in auth-context.tsx with proper error handling, immediate local state clearing, and comprehensive logging. Updated the sidebar logout handler to properly wait for sign out completion before navigation and added fallback navigation even if errors occur. The implementation now calls supabase.auth.signOut() with proper error handling and clears both user and profile state immediately for better UX.
- **USER**: Fix this error: createUnhandledError@ handleClientError@ error@ validateDOMNesting@ completeWork@ runWithFiberInDEV@ completeUnitOfWork@ performUnitOfWork@ workLoopSync@ renderRootSync@ performWorkOnRoot@ performWorkOnRootViaSchedulerTask@ performWorkUntilDeadline@ ul@unknown:0:0 LoginForm@
- **ASSISTANT**: Fixed React hydration error caused by invalid HTML structure in LoginForm component. The issue was a `<ul>` element nested inside a `<p>` element (lines 96-105), which is invalid HTML. Restructured the code to use a `<div>` container with separate `<p>` and `<ul>` elements, maintaining proper styling with Tailwind classes.
- **USER**: Make the SIgn out button actually log out of the account with Supabase Auth.
- **ASSISTANT**: Updated the sidebar logout functionality to use proper Supabase Auth. Replaced localStorage clearing with the signOut function from auth context, which calls supabase.auth.signOut() and properly handles authentication state management.
- **USER**: There seems to be a bug. I was playing around with the app and now when on http://localhost:3000/ I am stuck on an infinte Loading... screen.
- **ASSISTANT**: Debugged infinite loading issue caused by missing Supabase environment variables. Added error handling and debugging to auth context, created SupabaseConfigError component for better user experience, and provided step-by-step setup instructions. The issue was that .env.local wasn't configured with actual Supabase credentials.
- **USER**: Please wire up Supabase auth with my login page.
- **ASSISTANT**: Wired up Supabase authentication with the login page. Created Supabase client configuration with SSR support (client.ts, server.ts, middleware.ts), authentication context (auth-context.tsx), AuthGuard component for route protection, updated LoginForm to use real Supabase authentication instead of mock localStorage, and updated all protected pages (reports, locations, materials, comments, add report) to use AuthGuard. Created environment template file (.env.example) with required Supabase configuration variables.
- **USER**: What should I build my backend and database with?
- **ASSISTANT**: Recommended PostgreSQL with Next.js Route Handlers/Server Actions, Kysely for type-safe queries, and managed DB (Neon/Supabase). Provided detailed comparison of options.
- **USER**: Wouldn't it be easier just to use Supabase for all this?
- **ASSISTANT**: Confirmed Supabase as excellent choice, recommended hybrid approach (Supabase for auth/DB/storage, Next.js for API) for best developer experience.
- **USER**: I am going full Supabase. Please write me instructions to initialize Supabase for my project.
- **ASSISTANT**: Provided step-by-step Supabase initialization instructions including CLI setup, project creation, migration setup, and environment configuration.
- **USER**: I want to use Supabase's built in auth.users table as the source of truth for authentication. Please remove the users table I just created.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created migration `20250818223019_switch_to_auth_users.sql` to drop custom users table, create profiles table linked to auth.users, update foreign keys to UUIDs, set up RLS policies, and create auto-profile-creation trigger. Fixed UUID casting error by setting old integer author_ids to NULL during migration.
- **USER**: Please help me perform the actions in scripts 02-09 within Supabase.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created and applied migrations for scripts 03-09: locations/areas seeding, materials seeding, database views (updated for profiles table), statistics/triggers. Created Node.js script for test user creation since auth.users can't be seeded directly. Provided manual user creation instructions as alternative.
- **USER**: Yes, please continue with the next steps following option B.
- **ASSISTANT**: Installed dependencies, ran user creation script successfully creating 4 test users with UUIDs, updated migrations with real user IDs, created and applied final migrations for reports/pest findings, comments, and material links. Completed full database seeding equivalent to original scripts 02-09.
- **USER**: In @database-schema.md write me a markdown document outlining the structure of the database.
- **ASSISTANT**: Created `docs/database-schema.md` with a detailed breakdown of the database schema, including tables, views, and automation scripts.
- **USER**: Explain the architecture of the database that these sql scripts set up.
- **ASSISTANT**: Analyzed the SQL scripts and provided a detailed explanation of the Pestwise database architecture, covering core tables, design patterns, database views for analytics, automation features, and scalability considerations.

### WebSocket Error Explanation

**Prompt**: What's this browser console error mean?

**Error**: [Error] WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:3000/\_next/webpack-hmr' failed: WebSocket is closed due to suspension.

**Explanation and Troubleshooting Steps**:
This error typically indicates that the Hot Module Replacement (HMR) WebSocket connection, which Next.js uses to update your browser instantly when you make code changes, has failed.

**Potential Causes**:

1.  **Browser Tab Suspension/Throttling**: Some browsers might suspend or throttle background tabs.
2.  **Network Issues**: Intermittent network problems, firewalls, or VPNs can interfere.
3.  **Ad Blockers/Browser Extensions**: Certain extensions can sometimes block WebSocket connections.
4.  **Development Server Issues**: The Next.js development server itself might have crashed or become unresponsive.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:

1.  **Restart the Development Server**: Often the quickest fix.
2.  **Clear Browser Cache and Cookies**: Sometimes cached data can interfere.
3.  **Try a Different Browser**: Helps determine if it's browser-specific.
4.  **Check for Ad Blockers/Extensions**: Temporarily disable them.
5.  **Check Network and Firewall Settings**: Ensure nothing is blocking `localhost:3000`.
6.  **Update Node.js/npm**: Ensure Node.js and npm are up to date.
